# Godbolt test fragments

This repository contains a bunch of test fragments that can be copy-pasted into the [Compiler Explorer](godbolt.org).
Each fragment is a simplified example of some library code where I want to check that the expected optimizations are performed. 
See comments in each file for the context around the code and the expected behavior in the assembly.
